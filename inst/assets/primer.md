<span style="font-size:16.0pt"><b>Welcome to the Election Protection National Survey Dashboard</b></span>

The Election Protection Survey was conducted by Text to Mobile Online and Online Panel Interviews from April 21 - April 27, 2022 among a nationally representative random sample of 1000 registered voters. The survey measures many details of Americans’ concerns about fair election, which you can explore in this dashboard I developed.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt; font-color:#000000"><b>How to use the dashboard</b></span>

You can navigate within the dashboard pages through the left sidebar menu. Each page is divided into boxes that contain information.

The <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">input sidebar</span>, which can be shown or hidden via `Toggle Input Sidebar`, is where you choose what data you want to see. Start from the top then move down. Each selection has a drop-down menu that populates dynamically based on what you’ve selected before. After you have selected your inputs, the data should populate the boxes accordingly.

The `Reverse selected fields?` input box allows you to flip the selected fields in the table and the axes in the chart.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt"><b>How to use the interactive charts</b></span>

Interactive charts have the following features:

* Hover over the chart and you’ll see a tool panel appear in the top right corner. This tool panel allows you to do a few different things.

    * <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">Download</span> the charts as static png images by clicking on the camera icon in the modebar. Note that your downloaded images will be static representations of your *current* views of the charts.
    
    * <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">Drag and crop</span> specific areas of the charts with the magnifying glass icon in the modebar, allowing you to "zone-in" on specific subsets of the data. Double click any parts of the chart or click "auto-scale" in the tools panel to reset the charts to the default size. This can be helpful when your selected field has a large number of distinct values and the charts get crowded.
    
    * Change the view of the charts up and down as well as left and right with the <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">pan</span> icon.

* <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">Hover text</span> will appear when you move your cursor over the data, showing the specific data point. 

* <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">Filter data</span> in the bar charts by clicking on the data labels listed in the plot legend. This is useful for comparing specific subsets of the data. 

<span style="font-size:16.0pt"><b>Table features</b></span>

* The <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">search bar</span> allows you to filter the rows in the table. You can also filter for specific *keywords* using the syntax `^keyword$`.

* You can <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">download</span>, <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">copy</span>, and <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">print</span> the tables. <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">Note</span>: the <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">download</span> button only downloads the portion of the table in your current view. Toggle to "Show all entries" to download the entire table.
